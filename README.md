# Hey, I'm Thiago 

Strategy consultant at Kearney by day, building AI-powered tools for consulting workflows by night. Most of my time goes into transforming messy data into sharp executive narratives, financial models, and actionable recommendations for C-level audiences. On the side, I build tools that solve real problems I hit every day on the job. If a workflow is slow, repetitive, or context-heavy, I'll probably try to automate it.

## What I'm building

### 🔷 [ProcessLab](https://github.com/simoesthiago/processlab)
AI-powered BPMN modeling platform. Upload a document, image, or just describe a process in plain text — get a fully editable business process diagram. Built with Next.js, FastAPI, and a multiagent system for synthesis and layout.

### 🔄 [Workflow Improvement Planner](https://github.com/simoesthiago/workflow_improvement_planner)
Agentic AI workspace that takes a business process description and outputs an executive brief, technical blueprint, and implementation roadmap. Uses dual-agent architecture (Solution Designer + Prototype Builder) with built-in QA validation.

### 📋 [AI Categorizer](https://github.com/simoesthiago/ai_categorizer)
Local web app for categorical mapping at scale. Upload a spreadsheet, define target categories, and get back a fully classified file. Batch processing with retry logic, confidence scoring, and progress tracking. Built for the kind of messy vendor/expense data consultants deal with daily.

### 📖 [GenAI Consulting Handbook](https://github.com/simoesthiago/genai_consulting_handbook)
An opinionated field manual for taking GenAI from "good demo" to reliable production. Covers decision frameworks, architectural patterns, and implementation playbooks — written for two personas: the Deployment Strategist and the Forward-Deployed Engineer.

### 📁 [Consulting Skills](https://github.com/simoesthiago/consulting_skills)
Open-source prompt library that turns LLMs into consulting teammates. Modular skill files for slide creation, storyline building, Excel auditing, and more — each one embedding enough context about Pyramid Principle, MECE logic, and insight-driven titles to produce senior-level output.

### 🧙 [Investment Wizard](https://github.com/simoesthiago/investment_wizard)
Personal portfolio tracker for Brazilian and US markets. Auto-fetches prices for B3, FIIs, US stocks, and crypto. Tracks allocations, rebalancing targets, DCA plans, and portfolio evolution over time. Next.js + SQLite, fully local.

Tech I work with
Python · TypeScript · Next.js · FastAPI · Streamlit · SQLite · Tailwind CSS · OpenAI API · LLM Agents
And a lot of Excel. A lot of Excel.
